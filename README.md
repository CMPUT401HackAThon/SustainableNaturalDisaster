This project's is based on UN unsustianble goal: The partnerships for the goal.
This project's main goal is to suvervive in a region which is facing naturual diaster. There are many camps in the region,  but the material(such as food and water) of each camp will be lacking. Camp with insuffcient stuff can request material to other camps nearby in order to survive longer. We wish through this project, people can learn how to coopreate with each other.
